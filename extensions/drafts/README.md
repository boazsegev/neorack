# NeoRack Extension Drafts
[![NeoRack logo](../../resources/neorack_logo.png)](SPEC.md)

The specifications listed in this folder are optional and likely to be updated and/or changed before a stable version is made available.

Servers **MAY** implement some or none of these extensions, though it might be better if these extensions were implemented using gems or external code rather than having NeoRack Servers implement and optimize development versions.
